### Hey there, I’m **Jason Sharma** 👋

I’m a **full-stack developer** who thrives at the intersection of clean code, creative problem-solving, and constant learning.

- 🔨 **Tech toolbelt:** PHP (Laravel) &nbsp;|&nbsp; JavaScript (Vue.js) &nbsp;|&nbsp; Docker &nbsp;|&nbsp; GitHub Copilot  
- 🚀 **Side quests:** Building a SaaS from scratch and fine-tuning AI models to make software smarter.  
- 🌱 **Weekend ritual:** Carving out 5 laser-focused hours to upskill, explore new frameworks, and tinker with ML.  
- 🛠️ **Current lab project:** A culturally rich **Meitei naming app**—bridging language, identity, and tech.  
- 🧘 **Balance matters:** Mornings start with a body-scan meditation; evenings wrap up with a metal playlist and a bit of code-garden maintenance (yes, I literally grow plants 🌿).  
- 🗺️ **Region & roots:** Proudly crafting code from Manipur, India, and always open to global collaboration.  
- ✨ **Mission:** Build products that are robust, people-centric, and a joy to extend—while helping fellow devs level up along the way.  
- 💬 **Let’s chat:** If you’re into scalable back-ends, thoughtful UI, or AI-powered innovation, drop me a line!
